## The virtual machine
	This project makes use of the same Linux-based virtual machine (VM) as the preceding lessons.

	If you skipped those lessons and came right to this project, that's OK! However, you will need to go back to these instructions to install the virtual machine. This will give you the PostgreSQL database and support software needed for this project. If you have used an older version of this VM, you may need to install it into a new directory.


	Successfully logged into the virtual machine.
